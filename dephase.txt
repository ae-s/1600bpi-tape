The following is an extensive excerpt from ECMA 46, "Standard ECMA-46
for Data Interchange on 6,30 mm Magnetic Tape Cartridge (63bpmm, Phase
Encoded)".  Line breaks and spacing have been preserved exactly as
written; the original document is typed in a fixed-width font.

I obtained a copy of this standard from:
<http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-WITHDRAWN/ECMA-46,%201st%20Edition,%20March%201976.pdf>.

ECMA-46 is substantially similar to, and intended to be compatible
with:

* 3M DC300: a 300 foot data cartridge from 3M Company, first
  introduced in 1972.

* ANSI X3.56: "Information Systems - Recorded Magnetic Tape Cartridge
  for Information Interchange - 4 Track, 0.250 Inch (6.30 mm), 1600
  bpi (63 bpmm), Phase Encoded"

* ISO 4057: "Information processing -- Data interchange on 6,30 mm
  (0.25 in) magnetic tape cartridge, 63 bpmm (1 600 bpi)
  phase-encoded"

The encoding scheme defined herein is also referred to generically as
"1600 bpi phase encoding", and has been used on other varieties of
tape, including 9-track tape.

Another description of the encoding, with phase diagrams, can be found
in the "Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series", Module 23
("Magnetic Recording").  This document is in the public domain, and is
replicated all over the Web.  One such example is located at

6. RECORDING

 6.1 Method of recording

      The method of recording shall be phase encoding, described as
      follows:

  6.1.1 The tape before the first block, the interblock gaps and that
        part of the tape following the last block written, shall be
        erased with the same polarity.

        This polarity is such that the beginning of the relevant track
        is a North-seeking pole.

        This process forms part of the recording procedure.

  6.1.2 A ZERO bit is a flux transition to the polarity opposite to that
        of the interblock gap, when reading in the forward direction.

  6.1.3 A ONE bit is a flux transition to the polarity of the interblock
        gap, when reading in the forward direction.

  6.1.4 Additional flux transitions shall be written at the nominal mid-
        points between bit flux transitions as defined in 6.1.2 and 6.1.3,
        if required, to establish the proper polarity for the succeeding
        bits. These flux transitions shall be called phase flux transi-
        tions.

 6.3 Density of recording

  6.3.1 The density of recording is 63 bpmm nominal.

  6.3.2 The long term average bit spacing is the spacing between bit
        flux transitions that have been recorded continuously at a
        nominal density of 63 ftpmm and must be measured over a length
        of tape not less than 3,81 m.

        The long term average bit spacing shall be within ± 3 % of the
        nominal bit spacing of 15,9 um.

  6.3.3 The short term average bit spacing referred to a particular bit
        spacing is the average of the preceding four bit spacings.

        The short term average bit spacing shall be within the limits
        of ± 7 % of the long term average bit spacing.

        In addition, the short term average bit spacing shall not change
        at a rate greater than 2 % per bit.

 6.4. Flux transition spacing

  6.4.1 The spacing between successive bit flux transitions without an
        intervening phase flux transition shall be between 88 % and
        105 % of the short term average bit spacing. The spacing bet-
        ween successive bit flux transitions with an intervening
        phase flux transition shall be between 95 % and 112 % of the
        short term average bit spacing.

 7.4 Location of characters on the tracks

     Each character is located in a byte of eight bit-positions along
     the track numbered from 1 to 8 in order of recording.

 7.5 Sequence of recording

     The least significant bit is recorded first. The information to
     be interchanged is recorded serially by bit and by character.

                                             --byte--
             Bit-positions        :   ...4321876543218765432...
             Forward tape motion  :          ----->>>
             Resulting recording
             direction            :          <<<-----

 7.6 Code

     The characters shall be represented by means of the ECMA 7-Bit
     Coded Character Set (Standard ECMA-6) and, where required, of
     its extensions (Standard ECMA-35).

  7.6.1 Recording of 7-bit Coded Characters

        Each 7-bit coded character shall be recorded in bit-positions
        1 to 7 of a byte; bit-position 8 is recorded with value ZERO.
        The relationships shall be as follows :

        Bits of the 7-bit combination :    0 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1
        Bit-position in the byte :         8 7  6  5  4  3  2  1

  7.6.2 Recording of 8-bit Coded Characters

        Each 8-bit coded character shall be recorded in bit-positions
        1 to 8 of a byte. The relationship shall be as follows :

        Bits of the 8-bit combination :   b8 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1
        Bit-position in the byte :        8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

 7.7 Sequence of characters

     The sequence of characters from start towards end of a block
     shall correspond to the normal left to right sequence of a
     written line.

 7.8 Data block

     A data block shall consist of a preamble, data, CRC and a
     postamble. The data part of a data block shall contain a mini-
     mum of 6 bytes and a maximum of 2048 bytes.

 7.9 Control block

     A control block (known as tape mark) shall consist of a preamble,
     two bytes of eight ZERO each, and a postamble.

7.10 Gaps
 
 7.10.1 Integrity of Gaps

        The gaps shall be DC erased. Immediately before and after
        each block there shall be a length of at least 2,5 mm in
        which, exclusive of residual edge signals, there is no flux
        discontinuity capable of producing a read signal of more than
        10 % of half the Standard Reference Amplitude.

        In the remaining part of the gap one burst of spurious trans-
        tions can be tolerated, provided that the total number of
        spurious transitions is at most 7.

 7.10.2 Interblock gaps

        The interblock gap, i.e. the distance between two successive
        data blocks, shall have a minimum length of 30,5 mm and a
        maximum length of 1220 mm. Any gap in excess of 2000 mm shall
        be considered end of data on this track.

 7.10.3 Initial gap

        The gap between the LP marker and the first bit of the first
        data block shall be at least 152,4 mm.

 7.10.4 Gap polarity

        The polarity of all gaps shall be in the direction specified
        in 4.3.4.2.

7.11 Preamble and Postamble

 7.11.1 Preamble

        Immediately preceding data in each block the preamble con-
        sisting of 15 ZEROS and 1 ONE shall be written. When reading
        in the forward direction, the first flux transition shall be a
        ZERO transition. The preamble may be used to establish a
        timing sequence so that the data can be read in the forward
        direction.

 7.11.2 Postamble

        Immediately following data and the CRC in each block the post-
        amble consisting of 1 ONE and 15 ZEROS shall be written. When
        reading in the forward direction, the first flux transition
        shall be the ONE transition. The postamble may be used to
        establish a timing sequence so that the data can be read in
        the reverse direction.

7.12 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

     The 16-bit CRC shall be written in each data block following the
     data and immediately preceding the postamble. It is recorded in
     two bytes with the least significant bit recorded first. The
     polynomial generating the CRC is :

                       16    15    2
                      x   + x   + x  + 1

7.13 Useable recording area

     All data to be interchanged shall be written within the useable
     recording area, which, in forward direction, extends from at
     least 152,4 mm after the LP marker to at most 915 mm after the
     EW marker (see Fig. 1).
